# Instacart Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Instacart Recommendation System** is a personalized product suggestion model built using the **Instacart** dataset. The system aims to provide tailored product recommendations to users based on their past interactions, purchase history, and preferences. By leveraging advanced recommendation techniques, including **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid approaches**, it enhances user experience, boosts engagement, and helps increase sales on the platform.

### Features:
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests products based on a userâ€™s previous purchases and preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on the behaviors and preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests products that are similar to those a user has interacted with, based on item attributes like category and brand.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve the quality and accuracy of recommendations.
