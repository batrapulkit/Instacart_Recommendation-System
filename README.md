# Instacart Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Instacart Recommendation System** is a personalized product suggestion model built using the **Instacart** dataset. The system aims to provide tailored product recommendations to users based on their past interactions, purchase history, and preferences. By leveraging advanced recommendation techniques, including **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid approaches**, it enhances user experience, boosts engagement, and helps increase sales on the platform.

### Features:
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests products based on a user’s previous purchases and preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on the behaviors and preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests products that are similar to those a user has interacted with, based on item attributes like category and brand.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve the quality and accuracy of recommendations.

Dataset
The recommendation model uses the Instacart dataset, which contains anonymized transaction data from users of the Instacart platform. This dataset includes information such as:

User Data: User IDs, demographics, and order history.
Product Data: Product IDs, categories, and prices.
Transaction Data: Information about which products were bought by which users.
You can access the dataset from Instacart's Kaggle page.

Dataset Files:
orders.csv: Contains order data, including order ID, user ID, and order details.
order_products__train.csv: Contains information about the products in users' orders.
products.csv: Contains product details like name, category, and brand.
aisles.csv: Contains aisle information for the products.
departments.csv: Contains department information for the products.
System Overview
The Instacart Recommendation System provides personalized product recommendations to users using a combination of multiple approaches:

Collaborative Filtering: Recommends products based on the preferences and behaviors of similar users.
Content-Based Filtering: Suggests products similar to those a user has interacted with, using item attributes like category and brand.
Hybrid Model: Combines both approaches for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
Methodology
Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering uses user-item interaction data (e.g., purchase history) to recommend products. There are two types:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Finds similar users and recommends products they have purchased.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Finds similar products and recommends them to users.
Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering recommends products based on their attributes (e.g., category, brand, price). It uses the items a user has previously interacted with to recommend similar products.

Hybrid Approach
The Hybrid Approach combines both collaborative and content-based filtering to generate recommendations. By weighting both methods, this approach improves recommendation quality and handles challenges like the cold-start problem, where new users or products lack interaction data.

Usage
Once the system is set up and the dataset is loaded, you can use the recommendation system to suggest products to a user:

python
Copy code
from recommender import InstacartRecommender

# Initialize recommender system
recommender = InstacartRecommender(dataset_path="path/to/dataset")

# Get top 10 product recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 12345
recommended_products = recommender.get_top_n_recommendations(user_id, top_n=10)

# Display recommendations
print(recommended_products)
Evaluation
The recommendation system can be evaluated using several metrics:

Precision: Measures how many recommended products are relevant.
Recall: Measures how many relevant products were recommended out of all relevant options.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the difference between predicted and actual ratings (if available).
You can evaluate the model’s performance with the following code:

python
Copy code
from recommender import EvaluationMetrics

# Evaluate model performance
metrics = EvaluationMetrics(recommender)
metrics.calculate_precision_recall()
metrics.calculate_f1_score()
metrics.calculate_mae()
