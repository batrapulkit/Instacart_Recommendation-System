# Instacart Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Instacart Recommendation System** is designed to deliver personalized product suggestions to users based on their purchase history, preferences, and behavior. By using advanced recommendation techniques, including **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid approaches**, this system aims to improve user experience, increase engagement, and boost sales for the Instacart platform.

This project demonstrates the power of modern recommendation algorithms in e-commerce, enabling better product discovery and customer satisfaction.

### Key Features:
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggest products tailored to a userâ€™s past purchases and preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommend products based on the behaviors and preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggest products similar to those a user has previously interacted with, considering product attributes like category and brand.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combine collaborative filtering and content-based filtering for more accurate and diverse recommendations.

Dataset
The recommendation model utilizes the Instacart dataset, which contains anonymized transaction data from users on the Instacart platform. The dataset includes the following components:

User Data: User IDs, demographics, and order history.
Product Data: Product IDs, categories, and prices.
Transaction Data: Information about which products were purchased by each user.
You can access the dataset from the Instacart Kaggle page.

Dataset Files:
orders.csv: Contains order data, including order ID, user ID, and timestamps.
order_products__train.csv: Contains information about products ordered by users.
products.csv: Contains details about each product (name, category, brand, etc.).
aisles.csv: Contains aisle information for the products.
departments.csv: Contains department details for the products.
System Overview
The Instacart Recommendation System uses a hybrid approach that combines Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering to provide personalized product suggestions:

Collaborative Filtering: Uses user-item interaction data (e.g., purchase history) to recommend products by finding similar users or products.
Content-Based Filtering: Recommends products based on their attributes (e.g., category, brand) and the user's previous interactions.
Hybrid Model: Combines the strengths of both approaches for enhanced recommendation accuracy.
Methodology
Collaborative Filtering
Collaborative filtering is a widely used technique that recommends products based on user-item interaction data. It works in two ways:

User-Based Collaborative Filtering: Finds users with similar preferences and recommends products they have purchased.
Item-Based Collaborative Filtering: Finds items that are similar to products the user has purchased, and recommends them.
Content-Based Filtering
Content-based filtering suggests products based on their attributes. It uses product metadata (e.g., category, brand) and recommends products that are similar to the ones the user has previously interacted with.

Hybrid Approach
The Hybrid Approach combines both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, it can handle challenges like the cold-start problem (where new users or products have little interaction data) and improve recommendation accuracy.

# Usage
Once the system is set up and the dataset is loaded, you can use the recommendation system to suggest products to a user:


# Initialize recommender system
recommender = InstacartRecommender(dataset_path="path/to/dataset")

# Get top 10 product recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 12345
recommended_products = recommender.get_top_n_recommendations(user_id, top_n=10)

# Display recommendations
print(recommended_products)
Evaluate the Model
The performance of the recommendation system can be assessed using standard evaluation metrics such as Precision, Recall, F1-Score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE):


# Evaluate model performance
metrics = EvaluationMetrics(recommender)
metrics.calculate_precision_recall()
metrics.calculate_f1_score()
metrics.calculate_mae()
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the quality of the recommendations, you can calculate several key metrics:

Precision: The fraction of recommended products that are relevant.
Recall: The fraction of relevant products that were recommended.
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the difference between predicted and actual ratings (if available).
