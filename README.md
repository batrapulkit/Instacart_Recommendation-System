# Instacart Recommendation System

## Overview

The **Instacart Recommendation System** is a personalized product suggestion model built using the **Instacart** dataset. The system aims to provide tailored product recommendations to users based on their past interactions, purchase history, and preferences. By leveraging advanced recommendation techniques, including **collaborative filtering**, **content-based filtering**, and **hybrid approaches**, it enhances user experience, boosts engagement, and helps increase sales on the platform.

### Features:
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Suggests products based on a userâ€™s previous purchases and preferences.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Recommends products based on the behaviors and preferences of similar users.
- **Content-Based Filtering**: Suggests products that are similar to those a user has interacted with, based on item attributes like category and brand.
- **Hybrid Approach**: Combines both collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to improve the quality and accuracy of recommendations.

## Installation

To run the **Instacart Recommendation System** locally, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/instacart-recommendation-system.git
cd instacart-recommendation-system
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Initialize recommender system
recommender = InstacartRecommender(dataset_path="path/to/dataset")

# Get top 10 product recommendations for a specific user
user_id = 12345
recommended_products = recommender.get_top_n_recommendations(user_id, top_n=10)

# Display recommendations
print(recommended_products)
Evaluation
The recommendation system can be evaluated using several metrics:

Precision: Measures how many recommended products are relevant.
Recall: Measures how many relevant products were recommended out of all relevant options.
F1-score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measures the difference between the predicted and actual ratings (if available).
You can evaluate the model using the following code:

python
Copy code
from recommender import EvaluationMetrics

# Evaluate model performance
metrics = EvaluationMetrics(recommender)
metrics.calculate_precision_recall()
metrics.calculate_f1_score()
metrics.calculate_mae()
